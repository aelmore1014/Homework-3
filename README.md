# Password Generator
Using javascript I programmed the website to create a random password when the "generate password" button is pressed.  
When you press the "generate password" button you are prompted to enter how many letters you want in your password, if you want numbners in your password, if you want lower case letters, if you want upper case letters, and if you want special characters in your password.  After answering the prompts, your password will show up in the text box.
